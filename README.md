# Next.js 13 App Router - Links Not Working

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered in Next.js 13's App Router where links generated using the `next/link` component fail to navigate correctly.  The application renders without errors, however, clicking on the links produces no effect.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run dev`.
4. Observe that clicking the links does not change the page.

## Potential Causes

* Incorrect configuration of the App Router.
* A conflict with other libraries or plugins.
* A bug in the `next/link` component within the App Router context.

## Solution (bugSolution.js)

This issue was solved by ensuring that the paths in the `href` attributes correctly match the file structure and naming convention of the pages in the `app` directory.
